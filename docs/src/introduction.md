# Introduction
PCTS stands for Puzzle ECTS, inspired on the [European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System).

We use the PCTS points to track which employees have what training, certificates, experience, further education and adjust the salaries according to that.
