# General Guidelines
- Use common best practices for both Spring Boot & [Angular](https://angular.dev/style-guide#organize-your-project-by-feature-areas)
- Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) with the following types:
  - `feat`
  - `fix`
  - `build`
  - `ci`
  - `docs`
  - `refactor`
  - `test`
- Rebase before opening a PR, to ensure your branch is current
