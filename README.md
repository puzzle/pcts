## Development

### Git Hooks

There are some hooks, which are strongly encouraged to use.
Simply execute the following command:

```shell
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
```

### non-functional file formating

We use [markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint)
for formating markdown files
and [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) for formating yaml files.

#### Installation
